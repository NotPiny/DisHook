# DisHook
A stupid simple Discord webhook library. That's it no fancy stuff just a simple and intuitive way to send webhooks to Discord using simple message objects or just strings if that's what you prefer.

Don't expect many updates to this library as it's already pretty simple and does what it's supposed to do. If you have any suggestions or issues feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
